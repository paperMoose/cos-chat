forward. Under the time limits established by the EO, agencies will issue new guidance and regulations related to AI over the next three to 12 months. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER The Executive Order articulates a broad national policy toward AI. That policy turns on “eight  guiding principles and priorities,” and directs federal agencies to take actions with respect to each one. 6  1. Ensuring the Safety and Security of AI Technology. The EO’s safety and security provisions are extensive. Significantly,  the  EO  directs  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  to  require,  among  other requirements,  (i) “companies developing or demonstrating an  intent  to  develop potential  dual-use foundation models” (i.e.,  an  AI  model  trained  on  broad  data  without  supervision  that  could  pose  a serious risk to security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of  those  matters)  to  provide  to  the  Federal  Government,  on  an  ongoing  basis,  reports  or  records regarding development activities, “red-team” test results, and mitigation measures; (ii) certain reporting and other obligations for providers of Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas), including in relation to foreign persons using those services for training AI models that could be used in “malicious cyber-enabled activity”; and (ii) companies, individuals, and organizations to disclose the possession, development, or acquisition of “large-scale computing

passed in response to the Korean War, the DPA “confers upon the President a broad set of authorities to influence domestic industry in the interest of national defense,” and has been invoked in response to various crises, including the Covid-19 pandemic. 9  The EO also directs (i) the National Institute of Standards Technology (“NIST”) to establish “guidelines and best practices, with the aim of promoting consensus industry standards,” for AI systems, including by establishing guidelines for “red team” testing of dual-use foundation models, and “developing a companion resource to the AI Risk Management Framework” previously published by NIST; 10 (ii) the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of Homeland Security to issue regulations aimed at deterring cybersecurity  risks;  (iii) the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  and  the  Secretary  of  Energy  to  develop regulations to prevent the use of AI in chemical, biological and nuclear attacks; (iv) agencies that fund, or  are  otherwise  involved  with,  life-sciences  research  regarding  the  establishment  of  guidelines  and regulations related to the procurement of synthetic nucleic acids; and (v) the Secretary of Commerce to develop guidance related to the authentication of “synthetic content” (i.e., AI-generated  content), including authenticating content, tracking provenance of content, labeling synthetic content (such as by watermarking) and detecting synthetic content. 11  2. Promoting Innovation and Competition. The EO also includes provisions aimed at ensuring that the United States attracts AI experts and maintains a competitive landscape for AI research.

It also instructs the Secretary of Labor to develop guidelines on best practices to minimize AI’s harms to workers (including as to “job-displacement risks”, “labor standards and job quality” and the “implications for workers of employers’ AI-related collection and use of data about them”) and requires the National Science   Foundation   to   prioritize   funding   for   AI-related   education   and   workforce   development programs. 15  4. Advancing  Equity  and  Civil  Rights. The  EO  includes  broad  provisions  addressing  potential discrimination or other civil rights violations related to the use of automated systems and AI.

Federal Government programs and benefits administration.” 17 The EO also directs the Secretary of Labor, the Director  of the  Federal Housing Finance  Agency,  the Director  of the Consumer  Financial Protection  Bureau,  and  the  Secretary  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  to  use  their  existing authorities to prevent AI-related discrimination in federal contracting, consumer finance, and housing. 18  5. Protecting Consumers, Patients, Passengers, and  Students. The EO requires federal regulatory agencies—including agencies responsible for areas such as healthcare, transportation, education and communications—to take a series of specific actions “to protect American consumers from fraud, discrimination,  and  threats  to  privacy  and  to  address  other  risks  that  may  arise  from  the  use  of  AI, including risks to financial stability.” 19 Many  of  the  provisions  in  this  section  direct  agencies  to  take actions  directed  at  entire  industries,  such  as  healthcare/life  sciences,  transportation,  education,  and communications.  6. Protecting Privacy. The EO calls on the Office of Management and Budget to examine and evaluate the  federal government’s existing privacy policies and related procedures to “mitigate privacy risks potentially exacerbated by AI,” 20 direct NIST and the Secretary of Commerce to create guidelines for federal agencies to assess the efficacy of their cybersecurity measures, and direct the Director of the National Science Foundation in concert with other agencies to fund, coordinate, and implement privacy research. 7. Advancing  Federal  Government  Use  of  AI. The  EO includes  numerous  provisions  related  to  the federal government’s own use of AI,  which are  designed both to mitigate  the risks of AI and to encourage  agencies  to  use  AI  in  a  manner  that  is  responsible  and  appropriate.

and  it  directs  OMB  to  issue  for guidance for each agency to designate a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer to coordinate the agency’s use of AI, promote AI innovation, and manage AI-related risks. 23  8. Strengthening American Leadership Abroad. The EO directs various federal agencies to work with allies  abroad  to  develop  AI  standards  outside  of  the  military  or  intelligence  areas. It  also  requires agencies to work with international partners to promote AI research and to address cross-border threats to critical  infrastructure  involving  AI. 24 The EO coincides with the G7’s new cross-border  Guiding Principles on Artificial Intelligence and voluntary Code of Conduct under the Hiroshima AI Process (an international effort to develop global AI standards), which were also announced on October 30, 2023. IMPLICATIONS As noted above, the  EO  is broad  in scope and sets an ambitious  agenda for  the federal government to regulate potential risks and to cultivate potential opportunities associated with AI. By issuing the EO ahead    -4- Biden Administration Issues Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence October 31, 2023 of the EU’s adoption of the EU AI Act (expected later this year), 25 the Biden Administration is seeking to position the United  States  as a  global  leader  in AI regulation. The EO  also reflects a major  shift in U.S. policy   toward   proactive   regulation   of   AI   at   the   federal   level,   extending   well   beyond   the   Biden Administration’s 2022 “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights.” The EO does not impose direct obligations on private businesses. Instead, it directs agencies to use their existing legal authorities to take actions respecting AI. In many cases, the EO requires agencies to develop regulations or guidance relatively quickly, with the first rules expected by the end of January 2024. And by empowering federal agencies  with  broad rulemaking and regulatory powers, the EO anticipates that the regulation of AI will evolve in response to rapid changes in AI technology and deployment.

been fully implemented by federal agencies, it has the potential to address a number of fundamental risks associated with powerful AI models and related computing infrastructure. At  the  highest  level,  the  broad  and  systematic  coverage  by  the  EO  of  many  (if  not  most)  sectors  of  the American economy suggests that the federal government will become highly involved in shaping how new AI  technologies  are  implemented  in  the  United  States. This  degree  of  close  involvement  appears significantly greater than in prior waves of innovation in information technology, for which the exercise of federal regulatory power was often less direct and immediate. While this is consistent in some ways with trends in technology regulation in various jurisdictions during the past decade (e.g., expansions of foreign investment  filing  requirements,  growing  protections  for  personal  information  or  increasing  technology- specific investment and export prohibitions), the EO (and various follow-on guidance and regulations) will surely  affect  various  decision-points  for  companies  that  are  developing  and  implementing  AI,  and,  as  a result, crucially define the nature, scale, speed and risks of implementing AI technologies.  In terms of immediate practical implications, as agencies begin to solicit feedback in connection with the EO, businesses that wish to shape the content of agency guidelines and regulations should begin now to develop advocacy arguments and strategy to inform these decision-makers. Given the breadth of the EO, there will be businesses across dozens of industry verticals that may have an interest in the outcome of these  guidelines and  regulations. For  instance,  firms  that  have  interests  in  the  standards  development process should continue to engage NIST when it comes to the agency’s work on standards guidance, as the agency has been tasked  with  this responsibility  in the EO  and similar  initiatives. 26 Many of the EO’s directives are quite broad and therefore provide considerable leeway to agencies to develop AI policy, so agency-level advocacy will likely be important.

Key Considerations The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) introduced a wide range of new and enhanced tax credits across clean  energy  sectors,  including  renewable  energy,  clean  hydrogen,  nuclear  power,  carbon sequestration  and  more. The  IRA  also  enabled  project  owners  to  transfer  clean  energy  tax  credits  to unrelated  parties  in  exchange  for  cash. For  project  sponsors,  credit  transferability  facilitates  easier monetization of a project’s available tax credits. For prospective buyers, purchasing tax credits represents an opportunity to support clean energy projects and potentially bolster the buyer’s ESG credentials while acquiring credits at a discount from par. On  June  14,  2023,  the  Department  of  the  Treasury  and  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  released  further guidance on transferability under the IRA in the form of proposed regulations addressing the requirements and  process  of  electing  to  transfer  tax  credits. The  market  for  clean  energy  tax  credits  has  become substantially more active following the released guidance. We have accordingly outlined below important considerations to keep in mind for prospective tax credit purchasers.  Background on Transferability The IRA’s provisions on tax credit transferability allow eligible taxpayers to sell all, or any portion of, their eligible  credits  to  an  unrelated  party. 1 “Eligible taxpayers” are generally taxpayers that are neither tax- exempt nor governmental entities.

The ITCs are a one-time dollar-for-dollar tax credit for expenses invested in renewable energy properties.

The PTCs are a dollar-for-dollar tax credit based on the kilowatt-hours of clean energy produced.

of the project and whether the project qualifies for certain bonus credits linked to prevailing wage and  apprenticeship  and  domestic  content  requirements),  usually  for  the  10-year  period  after  the  clean energy facility is placed in service. 6  A  seller  of  eligible  tax  credits  may  not  transfer  any  carryback  or  carryforward  tax  credits. 7 However,  a purchaser of eligible tax credits may carry back or carry forward the purchased credits, which are generally allowed  a  three-year  carryback  period  (as  opposed  to  the  usual  one-year  carryback)  and  a 22-year carryforward period (as opposed to the usual 20-year carryforward). 8  To transfer the credit, a seller is required to register with the IRS through an electronic portal prior to making the transfer election and receive a valid registration number for each of the credit properties. 9 Then, the seller must file certain forms as part of filing its original tax return for the taxable year for which the credit is determined, not later than its due date (including extensions). 10 In order to claim the purchased credit, the purchaser must also include certain forms with its tax return (original or amended). 11  Key Considerations for Transferability Below are key considerations that any prospective purchaser of tax credits should bear in mind:  Price: Tax credits are generally sold at a discount, but the price can vary by the nature of the credit and  of  the  underlying  projects  (for  example,  a  one-time  purchase  for  an  ITC  vs. multiple  purchases available for a PTC), how far in advance the credit is purchased, the creditworthiness of the seller, the strength of seller indemnity or insurance and other factors.  Risk of Penalties and Recapture: Generally, tax

rather than the seller, remains liable for any recapture of the ITC, even though the purchaser may not be in a position to directly mitigate such risk themselves.  When the tax credit is subject to recapture and it is determined that there has been an “excessive” transfer, not only does the purchaser have to return the excess tax credits claimed, but the purchaser is  also  subject  to  a  20%  penalty  on  such  excess. 12 In  order  to  mitigate  recapture  risk  and  avoiding penalties, purchasers should consider:  Contracting with the seller for indemnification in the event of recapture;     -3- Buying U.S. Clean Energy Tax Credits? Key Considerations October 31, 2023  Obtaining  insurance  to  cover recapture  risk,  which  may  be  conditioned  on  certain  threshold requirements  being  met,  and  may  be  underwritten  based  on  supporting  documentation provided by a project developer; and  Doing sufficient diligence to ensure, among other considerations, that the seller is eligible for the tax credit and eligible to transfer the tax credit, the tax credit is eligible to be transferred, and the seller has followed all required procedures for making a valid transfer election.  Anti-Abuse  Measures:  Proposed  regulations  would  prohibit,  or  recharacterize,  tax  credit  transfers (and associated transactions) primarily intended to avoid tax liability beyond the limits intended by the IRA. 13 For  example,  a  seller  would  not  be  able  to  artificially  decrease  its  taxable  income  by undercharging  a  customer  for  services,  where  that  customer  is  making  up  for  the  difference  by purchasing clean energy tax credits from the seller.   Individual  Buyers:  It  will  be  very  difficult  for  most  individuals  to  utilize  the  purchased  tax  credits efficiently under the
